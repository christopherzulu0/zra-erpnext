-  Retrieval of **Standard Codes** (classification, VAT, excise, packaging, etc.)  
-  **Item Registration**: save ERPNext items with ZRA Smart API  
- **Sales Management**: Manages the full Sales lifecycle
- **Purchase Management** Manage the full purchase lifecycle in compliance with Zambia regulations
- **Import Management** Integrate with ERPNext Purchase and Stock modules for imported items
- **Stock Adjustment**: Handles real-time stock synchronization with ZRA
-  **Background Jobs** for async API calls  
-  **Integration Request Logs** for request/response traceability  



### Installation

You can install this app using the [bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench) CLI:

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_YOUR_BENCH
bench get-app $URL_OF_THIS_REPO --branch develop
bench install-app ca_erpnext_zra
# Apply patches and custom fields
bench migrate
```
##  Configuration

Then configure the app inside **ERPNext**:

1. Go to **Crystal ZRA Smart Invoice Settings** in ERPNext  
2. Enter your **Company**, **Server URL**, **TPIN**, and **API credentials(Auth Details)**  
3. Save and mark settings as **Active**  

---

## Features & Workflow

### 1. Device Initialization  

Before interacting with ZRA’s Smart Invoice system, the ERPNext instance must be initialized as a registered VSDC device.
This process associates your business TPIN and Branch ID (BhfId) with ZRA’s infrastructure.

- **Endpoint**: `InitializeDevice`  
- **ERPNext DocType**: `Crystal ZRA Smart Invoice Settings`  

![alt text](image-3.png)
This need to be done only once from Crystal ZRA Smart Invoice Settings using the smart action Initialize Device 

---

### 2. Authentication

The authentication module manages secure access to the **Crystal ZRA Smart Invoice API** using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.  
It ensures that all API requests to ZRA are authorized and compliant with security standards.

![alt text](image-2.png)

Note: An expired token or empty value triggers autamatic authentication when the user makes a request

####  Key Capabilities:
- Automated login using `/api/v1/Users/GetToken`
- Securely stores and refreshes the JWT before expiry
- Injects the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header into every API request
- Caches tokens in the **Crystal ZRA Smart Invoice Settings** doctype
- Transparent error handling and token renewal

####  Technical Notes:
- Managed via `ZRAAuthService` in `services/auth_service.py`
- Automatically refreshes tokens using per-request validation
- Logs authentication attempts in the **Integration Request** table for traceability


####  Example Response:
```json
{
  "Version": "1.0",
  "StatusCode": 200,
  "IsSuccess": true,
  "Result": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5..."
  }
}
```




### 3. Retrieval of Standard Codes  

![alt text](image-5.png)


To correctly classify items, ZRA requires standard codes such as:  
  
- **Item Type Codes** (`itemTyCd`)  
- **Packaging Unit Codes**  
- **Quantity Unit Codes**  
- **VAT / IPL / Levy / Excise Categories**  

These codes are retrieved from the **Smart API** and stored in **custom ERPNext doctypes** for reuse.  

![alt text](image-4.png)

---

### 4. Item Classification Codes  

![alt text](image-6.png)

Note: At the moment the API responds with only 1000 codes. You need to import the rest using Data import tool

ERPNext **Items** are linked to **Crystallised Smart doctypes**, where each field references a standard code from ZRA.  

For example:  

- `custom_smart_item_classification_code` → `itemClsCd`  
- `custom_smart_item_type` → `itemTyCd`  
- `custom_smart_country_of_origin` → `orgnNatCd`  
- `custom_smart_packaging_unit_code` → `pkgUnitCd`  
- `custom_smart_quantity_unit_code` → `qtyUnitCd`  



---

### 4. Saving Items (Item Management)  
![alt text](image-1.png)
Once Items are properly configured, they can be **registered with Smart Zambia**.  

The following fields need to be filled for saving an item successfully:
- `Smart Item Classification Code`  
- `Smart Item Type`  
- `Smart VAT Category Code`
- `Smart Country Of Origin` 
- `Smart Packaging Unit`  
- `Smart Quantity Unit` 
The saving of an item happens automatically on saving or updating the item on our ERPNext. Incase this doesn't due to any reason, the smart action button Register(Item) does the same.

![alt text](image-8.png)
The item shown here has already been successfully registered.


#### 🔹 Payload Builder  

We build a **ZRA-compliant payload** from ERPNext Item data.  

**Example Payload**:  

```json
{
  "tpin": "1234567890",
  "bhfId": "01",
  "itemCd": "ITEM-0001",
  "itemClsCd": "101",
  "itemTyCd": "1",
  "itemNm": "Sample Item",
  "itemStdNm": "Sample Standard Name",
  "orgnNatCd": "ZM",
  "pkgUnitCd": "PKG",
  "qtyUnitCd": "EA",
  "taxTyCd": "A",
  "btchNo": "BATCH001",
  "bcd": "8901234567890",
  "dftPrc": 100.0,
  "addInfo": "Test item for Smart Invoice registration"
}
```
---
 Once submitted, the system will:  

- Enqueue the request in **Frappe background jobs**  
- Send the payload to **Crystal VSDC API**  
- Log request/response in the **Integration Request doctype**  
- Mark the Item as **registered** upon success  
---

### 5. Sales Management
Manages the complete Sales Record lifecycle — from saving a sale to issuing invoices through the ZRA Smart Invoice platform.
![alt text](image-15.png)
The system supports the seamless creation and submission of sales for items already registered and authorized with ZRA. When a Sales Invoice is submitted in ERPNext, all details are automatically transmitted to the Smart Invoice system for signing.

If the automatic submission fails for any reason, the “Send Invoice” smart action allows you to manually resend the invoice for signing.

In addition, the module supports generating and saving both Credit Notes and Debit Notes linked to an existing sale.

#### Key Capabilities:

-Automatically builds and sends Sales Invoice,Credit Notes and Debit Notes payloads

- Integrates with /SalesInformation/SaveSales for sales save

- Integrates with /SalesInformation/SaveCreditNote for Return sales save

### 6. Purchase Management

#### Purchase Processing Workflow
![alt text](image-11.png)
The purchase process begins with the user fetching registered purchases from the ZRA system.

![alt text](image-12.png)
For each approved purchase, you can generate a Purchase Invoice after completing the required setup steps—this includes creating the supplier and creating/registering the item if it does not already exist.

The system also supports purchases from suppliers who are not registered with the authority.
In such cases, the user simply creates the supplier in the system and proceeds to create a standard Purchase Invoice without requiring ZRA registration.

### 7. Import Management
Import Processing Workflow
![alt text](image-13.png)

Similar to the purchase process, import handling begins with the user retrieving raised imports from ASYCUDA.
![alt text](image-14.png)
For each imported item that requires acknowledgement(Update Import Item), the user must first create and register the item, marking it as an Imported Item.
Once the item is registered, the user can proceed to generate a Purchase Invoice linked to that import entry 

### 8. Stock Adjustment
Stock Synchronization

The system handles real-time stock synchronization with ZRA, ensuring that all inventory movements remain consistent with the authority’s records.

Stock updates can originate from:

- Stock Entry

- Stock Reconciliation

- Purchase Transactions

- Sales Transactions

All stock movements are monitored through the Stock Ledger Entry, where the system checks the corresponding Voucher Type to determine the nature of the transaction.

When an item is created with an opening stock value, the system automatically generates a Material Receipt stock entry.

Additionally, all stock activity—including approved purchases, imports, sales, and other adjustment entries—is submitted periodically every 4 minutes, along with updated quantity balances, to maintain continuous synchronization with ZRA.

#### Key Capabilities:

Posts updated stock quantities to Smart Invoice system

Supports /StockItemInformation/saveStockItems



### Background Jobs & Integration Requests 

Item registration runs **asynchronously**:  

```python
enqueue(
    method=_process_item_registration,
    queue="long",
    job_name=f"Register Item {item.name} with Smart Zambia",
    timeout=300,
    item_name=item.name,
    settings_name=settings["name"],
)
```
- Jobs are visible under Background Jobs Desk

- Each request is tracked in Integration Requests
